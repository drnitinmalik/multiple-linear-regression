# Pre-regression steps, Regression model, Post-regression analysis

In regression (also known as function approximation), we are interested in predicting one (dependent) variable from one or more (independent) variables (of any datatype). If we have one independent variable it is simple regression e.g, predicting height from the weight. If there are more than one, it is multiple regression e.g. predicting height from weight and age.
